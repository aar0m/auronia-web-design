This website is akin to a mockup for a hypothetical business, Auronia. 
* It will be constituted of multiple pages utilizing HTML5 and CSS respectively
* Each page directly corresponds to a 'Certification Project' assigned by freeCodeCamp.
NOTE: This personal project applies graphic design skills and lessons learned from freeCodeCamp(https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

* ~~For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"~~
* ~~For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field~~
* ~~Inside the form element, you should have a select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from~~
* ~~Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute~~
* ~~Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute~~
